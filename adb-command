/// bundler errros
To resolve try the following:

Clear watchman watches: watchman watch-del-all.
Delete the node_modules folder: rm -rf node_modules && npm install.
Reset Metro Bundler cache: rm -rf /tmp/metro-bundler-cache-* or npm start -- --reset-cache.
Remove haste cache: rm -rf /tmp/haste-map-react-native-packager-*.
The files mentioned in step 3 and 4 may not exactly have the same name (e.g. metro-cache or haste-map-metro). 
To make sure you delete the temp files, navigate to /tmp directory and delete anything with metro or haste in it, yourself.
